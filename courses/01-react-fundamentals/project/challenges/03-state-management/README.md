# Challenge 03: State Management with Context

## Problem Statement

Implement a theme switcher using React Context API to manage global state. Create a theme system that allows users to switch between light and dark modes. The theme should be:
- Accessible throughout the app via Context
- Persisted to localStorage
- Applied to all components

## Instructions

1. Create a `ThemeContext` in `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`
2. Create a `ThemeProvider` component
3. Create a `ThemeToggle` component
4. Wrap the app with the ThemeProvider
5. Apply theme classes/styles throughout the app

## Visual Requirements

- Clear toggle button/switch
- Smooth transition between themes
- All components should reflect the theme change
- Theme preference should persist on page reload

## How to Verify

1. Run `npm run dev` and open the app
2. Navigate to `/challenge/03-state-management` (or click "View Challenge UI" from the home page)
3. Click the theme toggle - the entire app should change theme
4. Refresh the page - the theme should persist
5. All components should respect the current theme

## Technical Requirements (What Will Be Reviewed)

### Functional Requirements

1. ✅ Must create ThemeContext using createContext
2. ✅ Must create ThemeProvider component
3. ✅ Must provide theme state and toggle function via context
4. ✅ Must persist theme to localStorage
5. ✅ Must load theme from localStorage on mount
6. ✅ Theme must be accessible via useContext hook
7. ✅ Must support at least "light" and "dark" themes
8. ✅ Theme changes must apply to all consuming components

### Code Quality Requirements

1. ✅ Context must be properly typed with TypeScript (ContextType interface)
2. ✅ Must handle localStorage errors gracefully (try-catch or null checks)
3. ✅ Must use proper React Context patterns
4. ✅ Code must pass ESLint checks (no errors, warnings allowed)
5. ✅ No console.log, console.error, or console.warn statements in production code
6. ✅ Code must be readable and well-structured
7. ✅ Variable and function names must be descriptive and follow camelCase convention

### Architecture Requirements

1. ✅ Context must be in `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`
2. ✅ Must use createContext to create the context
3. ✅ Must use useContext hook for consuming context
4. ✅ Provider component must wrap app in proper location (App.tsx or main.tsx)
5. ✅ Must use custom hook (e.g., `useTheme`) for context consumption
6. ✅ Must follow React Context best practices
7. ✅ Must use functional component pattern (not class component)

### Best Practices Requirements

1. ✅ Context must be properly typed with TypeScript interface
2. ✅ Custom hook must handle context undefined case (throw error or return default)
3. ✅ Provider must manage state using useState
4. ✅ localStorage operations must be in useEffect hooks
5. ✅ Must handle localStorage read/write errors gracefully
6. ✅ Theme state must be properly initialized (default to 'light' or from localStorage)
7. ✅ Toggle function must be properly implemented
8. ✅ Context value must be memoized or properly structured
9. ✅ Must follow React Context best practices (separate Provider and hook)
10. ✅ Code must be maintainable and follow single responsibility principle

### Industry Standards

The following industry standards will be checked:

- **TypeScript**: Proper type safety, ContextType interface
- **React Patterns**: Context API, custom hooks, Provider pattern
- **Code Style**: ESLint compliance, consistent formatting
- **Naming Conventions**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components
- **State Management**: Proper useState usage, localStorage integration
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of localStorage errors
- **Component Design**: Proper separation of concerns, reusable context pattern


**Important**: Review will **ONLY check what's specified above**. No hidden requirements.

## Learning Hints (no solution code)

- **Context**: Use React's `createContext` and `useContext`. Provide a value object (e.g. `{ theme, setTheme }` or `{ theme, toggleTheme }`). Wrap the app (or a subtree) in the Provider.
- **Persistence**: Read/write `localStorage` in a `useEffect` (or when toggling) so the theme survives refresh. Key name is up to you; tests check behavior.
- **ThemeToggle component**: A button that calls the context's toggle function. Must be used inside the Provider.

## Next Steps

1. **Read this file** - All requirements are listed above
2. **Implement the context** - Follow the instructions and requirements
3. **Verify visually** - Run `npm run dev` and check `/challenge/03-state-management`
4. **Run review** - `npm run review -- --challenge=03-state-management` to get scored

**Setup**: If you haven't run setup yet, go to repo root and run `npm run setup` to install all dependencies and Playwright browsers.  
**Full guide**: See repo root [README.md](../../../../../README.md) for setup, workflow, and completion policy.
